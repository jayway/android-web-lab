				We carefully select from boutique wineries that we feel best represent the area they come from. For over a decade we have fostered excellent relationships with wineries all over Italy, from Piedmont down to Sicily, and we travel there often and stay up-to-the-minute on Italian wine.
				Our goal is to offer you a great bottle of wine at a great price and conveniently ship it to your door. We work hard to find the best price to quality ratio so that you get an excellent value.
				We aim to offer you an online shopping experience like no other by making it personal. Meet us and our wineries in our weekly newsletter. Don’t know which wine to choose or have a specific question about a wine? Contact Ciao Daniel, he would be happy to help.
